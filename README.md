## School District Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to provide the District Board with a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

* Total number of students
* Total number of schools
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* Percentage of students who passed math
* Percentage of students who passed reading
* Overall passing percentage

In addition to these district level metrics, analyses were also provided at the school level in order to get a better picture of student performance at each school in the district as well as school budgets and spending per capita.
